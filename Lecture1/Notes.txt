Source Code->Compiler->Machine Code

Machine Code generated in one O/S can be used in a similar O/S because during compilation the compiler imports functionalities from the O/S. 
Thus we need different compiler for different programing Languages. To remedy this Java was developed.

Q1. Why not develop a Universal Compiler?
Ans1. Machine Code generated in one O/S can be used in a similar O/S because during compilation the compiler imports functionalities from the O/S.

Q2. Why Java?
Ans2. S/W developers have to use programing languages according to the Client's System requirenment. Since java can run on any system, it was a 
game changer.
